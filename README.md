# QuickUp
A faster, native client for ClickUp

QuickUp is written entirely in SwiftUI, using ClickUp's public API. It is **not** intended to be a replacement for the ClickUp website or desktop client. It functions primarily as a means to view tasks quickly (at least, for the time being while ClickUp's public API does not provide complete functionality).
